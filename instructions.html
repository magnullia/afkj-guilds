                <li>If you are in the incorrect guild, leave it. This starts a 30-minute cooldown, after which you are able to join the new guild.</li>
                <li>It's okay if you don't immediately get in. There will be some delays as slots open and close. Just be patient.</li>

                <li>Please wait to leave your guild until everyone else has completed moving. We need your help to accept applications.</li>
                <li>If you see a pending application, reference the member list. If it looks right, accept it; otherwise, just leave it for a main leader to figure out.</li>
                <li>Please direct any questions to the main leaders. They are the most knowledgeable about this.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feel free to reach out with any questions! We want this to go as smoothly as possible.</p>
